        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>To a large pot, combine the beef stock, green onions, chopped cilantro, ginger, bay leaves, peppers, cloves, star anise, black peppercorns, coriander seeds, and Japanese sake. Bring the mixture to a boil and lower to a simmer. Simmer the broth for 1 1/2 hours, covering the broth after 1/2 hour. Strain the broth into a bowl and then transfer it back to the pot. Keep warm on the stove until you are ready to serve.
            In a large bowl, combine all of the ingredients for the meatballs, except for the vegetable oil. Using clean hands or a large wooden spoon mix the ingredients together until fully combined. Line a baking sheet or large plate with parchment paper and form the meat into tablespoon-sized balls.
             Cover them with plastic wrap and place them in the fridge to firm up for about 30 minutes.
            Heat vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet set over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs and brown on two sides. Lower the heat to medium-low and cover. Cook for 25-30 minutes or until the meatballs are cooked through.
            Transfer to a large plate and cover with foil until you are ready to serve.</p>
